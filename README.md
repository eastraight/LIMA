# LIMA
An app for educating pastors and church leaders on domestic violence. Made for the organization Paz y Esperanza in Lima, Peru.


An English description of the project's progress so far (04/05/2021)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Drafted
-------

UI  
-The general structure of the interface is modeled after the interface of the app "Tech Safety."  
-The home section has buttons for the 8 modules, 7 of which are completed for now. They each contain information on a topic and are organized with collapsible subheadings.  
-The drawer menu currently has the option to sign in or to share the application.  

STRINGS - strings.xml  
-Because the primary goal of the app is to provide educational content, most of the app is text. The strings file contains all of the formatted text and tables' text, etc.

QUIZZES  
-The multiple-choice quizzes store user answers in a SQLite database and keep track of the user's highscore.


In Progress
------------

GOOGLE SIGNIN  
-The app will use the Google API to have a sign in option. This will be useful in viewing other users' progress, which is to come next.


To Come
--------

VIEW OTHER USERS' PROGRESS  
-The app will offer the ability to connect with other users with the app in order to view their progress.  
-This feature is important so that churches can see who has completed the training modules and so that individuals have community encouragement to make progress.

SHARE THE APP  
-This will be a simple way to send friends a link to the app on the Google Play Store to make it easy to share.

MORE QUIZZES  
-I am waiting on the questions and answers to all modules' quizzes besides the first module.

SECTIONS TO ADD  
-I am waiting on the contents of another section (now the button "[otro]", someday to be "Violencia de g√©nero").

GRAPHIC DESIGN CHANGES  
-I am waiting on more images and more directions for what colors to use.  
-The app needs a text size adjustment option and/or zoom options.
